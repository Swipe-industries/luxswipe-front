# React Project Setup Guide

Welcome to our React App! This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/Swipe-industries/luxswipe-front

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd project-directory

3. **Install Node Modules:**
npm install

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project. Note that Node modules might have been ignored in the main branch, so you need to install them locally.

4. **Start the Development Server:**
npm run dev

This will start the development server using Vite, allowing you to view your React application in the browser.

5. **Open in Browser:**
Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the React application.

## Additional Commands

- **Build the Production Version:**
npm run build

This command will create a production-ready build of your React application in the `dist` directory.

- **Run Tests:**
npm test

This command will run any test suites associated with the project.
